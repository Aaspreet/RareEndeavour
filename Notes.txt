Currently using EXPO_PUBLIC as dotenv isnt working with expo router. Take a look later.

Add the:
<KeyboardAvoidingView
        className="bg-red-500 flex-1 justify-center"
        behavior="padding"
        keyboardVerticalOffset={-100}
      >
to login.jsx

Make the username pop down on register.jsx smoother
I also want to be able to automatically focus on the select username field on continue
