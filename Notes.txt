Currently using EXPO_PUBLIC as dotenv isnt working with expo router. Take a look later.

Add the:
<KeyboardAvoidingView
        className="bg-red-500 flex-1 justify-center"
        behavior="padding"
        keyboardVerticalOffset={-100}
      >
to login.jsx

Make the username pop down on register.jsx smoother
I also want to be able to automatically focus on the select username field on continue

Figure out what the hell I cant put textinput into its own component and then render that component in register.jsx. It would make code much cleaner, but
the textinput is losing focus everytime a character is entered.
