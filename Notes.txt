Currently using EXPO_PUBLIC as dotenv isnt working with expo router. Take a look later.

// Make the username pop down on register.jsx | smoother animation
//- I also want to be able to automatically focus on the select username field on continue

Figure out what the hell I cant put textinput into its own component and then render that component in register.jsx. It would make code much cleaner, but
the textinput is losing focus everytime a character is entered.

Oganize dependencies and dev dependencies

// Smooth out the register and login UI and design.

Tell user email doesnt exist if verification email fails to send.

I hate the register/login system. Its confusing. I hate the UI. Fix it.

Ive removed this from the rootlayout because I dont know if this is the right approach:
useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribeAuthState = onAuthStateChanged(auth, async (user) => {
      setLoading(false);
    });

    return () => {
      unsubscribeAuthState();
    };
  }, []);
